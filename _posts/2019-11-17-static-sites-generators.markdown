What do you think of static site generators?

* What type of projects are they suitable for?

I think that static site generator is a very useful and timesaving tool because it really saves a lot of time for the build phase of a site.
Developer gets almost ready structure of the site, which one can edit and set according to some criteria and requirements.
Static site generators are easy to install and start a new project, for example to install Jekyll it's enough to run the following command in terminal:

~~~~
sudo apt-get install jekyll
~~~~

and to create a new project:

~~~~
jekyll new mynewsite
~~~~

Modern Static sites generators have a lot of templates and it allows to create various sites with different purposes in the contrary to the past,
when they only helped to make a one-page "card" websites.
Apart from that they have a great amount of plugins which allow to add functionality to the website, for example comments or sharing in the social media.
Another advantage is a possibility to work offline which is very convenient.

Static Site Generators only are suitable for static sites which is clear from their name. They do not support any backend, but on the other hand they have better perfomance and work faster because hosted on CDN.
Generators are used for less complex sites like blogs, informational sites, portfofio websites, etc.
