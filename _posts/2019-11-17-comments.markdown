How did you implements comments to blog posts?

Luckily Jekyll has plugins for allowing comments on the pages. Apart from that there is a file disqus_comments.html in *_includes* folder that has all the settings and script
If-statement code is used then in post layout which tells that if there is a disqus shortname, then comments will be included in post's layout.

Thus, all I needed to do is to sign up on disqus page and add two lines of code in my config file:

~~~~
disqus:
  shortname: mariia-roze-blog
~~~~

to "inform" about my disqus shortname and then disqus_comments.html is included into the layout.
