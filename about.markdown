Hi and welcome to my personal blog. My name is Maria Roze, I am combining work and studies, which is not easy sometimes. 
Currently I am a student of Linneaus University and reading a program in web programing. I enjoy studying it but I wish I had more time for it.
My first university degree is in linguistics, I have always liked languages and that is one of my hobbies: I like to teach and read different articles in linguistics. Now I sometimes teach english in Medborgarskolan as a "freetime activity".
Another hobby is literature, I really enjoy reading and discussing books, mostly classic literature. My favourite author is Jane Austen.
