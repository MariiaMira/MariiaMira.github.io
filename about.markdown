Hi and welcome to my personal blog. My name is Maria Roze, I am combining work and studies, which is not easy sometimes. 
Currently I am a student of Linneaus University and reading a program in web programing. My first university degree is in linguistics, 
I have always liked languages and that is one of my hobbies: I like to teach and read different articles in linguistics.
Another hobby is literature,I really enjoy reading and discussing books, mostly classic literature.
